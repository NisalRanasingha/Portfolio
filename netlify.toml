# netlify.toml

# ==================================
# 1. BUILD CONFIGURATION (MIME FIX)
# ==================================
[build]
  # Tells Netlify to run your standard build script
  command = "npm run build"
  # Tells Netlify to serve the compiled output folder
  # Change to "build" if you used Create React App
  publish = "dist" 


# ==================================
# 2. REDIRECTS (FOR REACT ROUTER/SPA)
# ==================================
# This is crucial for single-page applications (SPAs)
# It routes all unrecognized paths back to index.html
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# ==================================
# 3. FUNCTIONS (IF YOU USE THEM)
# ==================================
# [functions]
#   directory = "netlify/functions"
